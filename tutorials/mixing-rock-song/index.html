            <h1>Mixing a rock song</h1>

            <p>After recording all the instruments in a song, you end up with a bunch of files in your computer that add
                little to human cultural progress. If everything went according to plan, you’re now a proud owner of a
                diamond in the rough… at best. If not, you’ll find out soon enough.</p>

            <p>During the last months, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/JáFoiTudoInventado-JFTI/187323597970550">JFTI</a>,
                a Portuguese rock band from <a
                        href="https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Peniche/@39.3372613,-9.3326849,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd1f45b08a64629b:0x400ebbde4903650">Peniche</a>,
                spent some days at Soul Harvest Studios
                (<a href="https://www.google.pt/maps/place/Alfeizer%C3%A3o/@39.4883597,-9.0991309,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xd18add522e3ec7f:0xfb7bc3af0bf635da">Alfeizerão</a>),
                recording drums, bass, guitars and voice for their upcoming album. All this work was led
                by Diogo Simão, I’ve only picked it up by now, at the mixing stage. This gave me a good opportunity to
                document how I approach mixing a standard, bass-guitar-drums-voice rock song, while explaining and
                exposing with some detail the decisions I make along the way. I will be writing this article as I go, so
                I will try to have a decent mix at first try… fingers crossed.</p>

            <p>The mixing process is somewhat a creative activity, but there are also a lot of best practices involved.
                Do take this guide with a grain of salt and feel free to <a href="mailto:tiagosimao@gmail.com">give me
                    feedback</a>, especially if you find
                something inaccurate, wrong or plain stupid.</p>

            <p>The song I'm attempting to mix is called Cegueira (Portuguese for blindness) and consists of a total of
                29
                (96kHz 24 bits mono) recorded tracks, handed to me by Diogo Simão in .wav format through the internet.
                Track list follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 bass track</li>
                <li>3 vocal tracks: 1 for lead vocals and 2 for backing vocals</li>
                <li>4 clean guitar tracks generated from 2 recorded takes: 2 reamped through a Carvin Quad and 2 through
                    a Marshall JCM 900
                </li>
                <li>4 lead guitar tracks generated from 2 recorded takes: 2 reamped through a Preavey 6505 and 2 through
                    a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier
                </li>
                <li>6 distorted rhythm guitar tracks generated from 2 recorded takes: 2 reamped through a Preavey 6505,
                    2 through a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier and 2 through a Marshall JCM 900
                </li>
                <li>11 drum tracks: sub-kick, inside-kick, snare top, snare bottom, tom 1, tom 2, tom 3 top, tom 3
                    bottom, overhead left, overhead right and mono ambience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These tracks, in the form of uncompressed .wav files, are the starting point of the mixing process. As of
                now and for a big number of reasons, they sum up to a big mono mess.</p>

            <p> This doesn’t mean that our raw
                material sounds bad. When recording, our focus should be getting the best and the most out of each
                instrument and not worrying too much about the sum.
                Mixing is about making the sum sound great, many times by making each instrument sound a bit “worse”.
                That’s why the “fix it in the mix” kind of thing summons so much hate. It makes no sense. If you got
                something wrong while recording an instrument, it will probably get even worse in the mix.</p>

            <p>I start by importing all the files to a new project (in my case, using Cubase), playing them out to check
                if everything is OK, grouping and naming them in a way that suits my work method. I will also create
                some
                submix channels in order to easily control each instrument as a whole, and to create stereo image on
                some of them (all except the bass actually), by hard-panning the guitar takes, the back vocal takes and
                the overhead mics. This song has the following 7 instruments: Lead voice, background voice, bass guitar,
                clean electric guitar, distorted electric guitar, lead electric guitar and drums.</p>

            <h2>Drums</h2>

            <p>
                I’ll start with the drums, since it’s the most complex instrument to mix in this song. I’m sure to find
                many bleed, phase and dynamic issues in a 11 mic drum recording.
                I solo the drum submix first to get an overall notion of what we’re looking at. The kick has little
                volume, the toms are too loud and the snare is to harsh… but that’s pretty much how a drum sounds with
                this mic setup.
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="drums-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>The raw drums
            </p>

            <h3>Overheads</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="oh-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Overheads@before
            </p>
            <p>
                The overheads were recorded using the ORTF mic placement. It’s important to know how the mics are placed
                in
                the room, so you can know what to expect. Stuff like M/S mic positioning doesn’t make sense if who is
                going
                to mix is unaware of this.
                I routed both overhead mics to a stereo group, removed the low frequencies (< 200Hz) and used a fast
                attack
                compressor to lower the snare, toms and kick drums transient information while enhancing the sound
                between
                each hit (mainly cymbal sustain).
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="oh-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Overheads@after
            </p>


            <h3>Subkick</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="subkick-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Subkick@before
            </p>
            <p>
                From this mic, I only want to use the low end, so a very aggressive low-pass is in order. Everything
                above
                100Hz will be discarded. Let’s not forget that the other kick drum also captures low-end information and
                I
                don’t want the two competing with each other. A slow 3:1 compressor is also applied to keep the dynamic
                range in check. Using a fast attack compressor would cut off the low frequency transient information.
                Not
                only we don’t want that, we also don’t need the stuff happening between kick hits, so a gate (fast
                attack
                and fast release) is in order, as it will help to remove much of the bleed coming from the other drum
                pieces. After doing all this, this track should sound like a heart thumping.
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="subkick-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Subkick@after
            </p>

            <h3>Kick</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="kick-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Kick@before
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we already have a good low end from the subkick, I don’t need to struggle to get that from this
                mic, I
                can instead concentrate in getting a good kick drum sound. To sound like a cool rock kick drum, I’ll
                notch
                that 150Hz-ish sound, increasing the contrast between the low end and the mids. I might also come back
                to
                boost the batter sound (somewhere from 3 to 7 kHz) Except for the EQ, I’ll do an identical processing as
                I
                did for the subkick (compressor and gate-wise).
                Now I check the phase between the kick and the subkick and tweek it if necessary. This is a critical
                detail,
                specially in low-end instruments. An off-phase sub-kick/kick will pretty much destroy your mix!
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="kick-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Kick@after
            </p>
            <p>
                <audio src="kickdrum-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Kick + Subkick@after
            </p>

            <h3>Bottom Snare</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="snare-bottom-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Bottom Snare@before
            </p>
            <p>
                The sole purpose of this mic is to get more snap from the snare so I’ll gate it and only use above
                250-300Hz. Since the snare drum has such an extreme dynamic range, I’ll use a hash compressor with fast
                attack in this sound source.
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="snare-bottom-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Bottom Snare@after
            </p>

            <h3>Top Snare</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="snare-top-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Top Snare@before
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of the most important tracks in a rock mix. I just keep coming back to this during the whole
                mix
                process. Eitherway I start with a low-cut on the 100Hz, gate and compressor. This particular recording
                has a
                lot of bleed from the cymbals so we may have some problems here, as all the processing I apply to this
                track
                is equally applied to whatever bleeds in.
                Again I check the phase between the top and bottom snare mics.
            </p>

            <p>
                <audio src="snare-top-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Top Snare@after
            </p>
            <p>
                <audio src="snaredrum-after.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>Top + Bottom Snare@after
            </p>
            <h3>Toms</h3>

            <p>
                A common mistake when mixing drums is to treat all toms as if they were the same thing. They are not.
                Their
                placement, tuning, mic placement, preamp gain, bleed, etc... is seldom the same as is the resulting
                sound.
                A second mic was used in the third tom, pointed at the bottom head, so I want to look at that with some
                attention.
                This drumset has 3 toms used in some breaks during the song. I got them already (manually) gated, so I
                don’t
                have to use any gate on them and that’s great.
            </p>

            <h3>10’’ Tom</h3>

            <p>
                <audio src="tom1-before.wav" preload="none" controls="controls"></audio>
                <br/>10'' Tom@before
            </p>
            <p>
                I start by low-cutting 100Hz to remove rumble. This tom is only played twice during the song, so I would
                manually gate it either way. It sounds pretty good to me so I won’t EQ it. I use a bit of slow
                compression
                and pan it according to what I hear in the now-stereo overheads. In this case, slightly to the left.</p>

                Unlike the first tom, this one seems to have an unbalanced sound. I applied a notch on the 200Hz, on top
                of
                an 100Hz low cut, compress it and pan it slightly to the right. Again trying to match what I hear in the
                overheads. I compare it to the first tom and adjust the volume fader to even them out.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the breaks finish on this tom and are followed by a crash hit that unfortunately bleeds in quite
                severely in the top mic. I want to fix this so I will reduce “gate” release, by fading out the tom sound
                sooner. Unfortunately this will greatly reduce it’s sustain. Again, the mix will hopefully sound better
                by
                chopping stuff out of an instrument.
                Since we have two mics for this drum piece, phase is an issue. Keeping that in mind, I use a 100Hz low
                cut
                on the top mic and a 200 Hz hi cut on the bottom. I pan the top to the right and keep the bottom in the
                center of the mix since I don’t want any bass off-center.

                A single mic was used to record room sound. This can be used in many creative ways and I chose to use it
                like the side mic of a M/S mic pair. To do this, I hard-left-paned this to a stereo track,
                hard-right-paned
                an inverted (phase) copy of it.
                The result is a stereo track that when summed to mono results is nothing.
                This means that the drum room will only be heard in stereo systems.
                I also delayed the sound by a few milliseconds, to emulate a larger room.

            <h3>Buss compression</h3>

            <p>
                Additionally I added a mono track to where I routed a copy of the processed kick, snare, tom1, tom2 and
                tom3. Used an extreme compression on this new track and hi-cutted everything above 10kHz. This track can
                be
                blend with the drum mix in order to get more or less aggressive drums.

            <h2>Bass</h2>

            <p>This bass track was recorded directly into an audio interface so, no bleed or acoustic noises exist. Also
                since it’s a single sound source, no phase issues here too.
                I start by splitting the bass signal in two. One will have the bass full sound, while the other will
                have a distorted copy. Whether the bass sounds more or less distorted can then be automatized along the
                song later on.
                I apply a hard and fast compression to the main bass track, since I don’t want low-frequency transient
                from the bass, only low-frequency sustain. I also cut some volume around 400Hz in order to get some room
                for the distorted guitars and drums.
                Now comes the tricky part: setting the bass and kick drum apart. This can make or break a mix. Low
                frequencies are fat and slow, so if an instrument is doing its stuff let’s say around 80Hz, no other can
                be messing around there at the same time. There are several ways to do this, but no safe recipe. In this
                mix I will try to boost the kick on a frequency where I notch the bass, while in other relatively close
                frequency I do the opposite. Let’s say on 60Hz I boost the kick and cut the bass, while on 80 Hz I boost
                the bass and cut the kick. The Q of these EQs have to be very high.</p>

            <h2>Guitars</h2>

            <p>Using the same guitar take to feed several amps or using more than one mic on the same amp can and will
                cause phase problems. This is the first thing I try to find and fix. Realizing the tracks are out of
                phase after mixing, basically forces me to start all over again.
                In this song, the clean, the lead and the rhythm guitars all use more than one amp.
            </p>

            <h3>Clean guitars</h3>

            <p>From the original two clean guitar takes, 4 tracks came out. I simply hard-paned each take, putting both
                de Carvin and the Marshall on both sides, did some low-cutting on the 100Hz and a soft ratio, fast
                attack compression to mellow out those strumming peaks.</p>

                <br/>Clean Guitars@after
            </p>
            <h3>Distorted guitars</h3>

            <p>Tri-amping was the way to go and I make no plans on discarding anything. I hard-paned each of the three
                amps both left and right, same way as I did with the clean guitars. As of now I won’t mess with the
                relative volumes, all the amps bring different things to the table and I want to see how far can I get
                without starting to cut off some of their tone. Besides the 100Hz low cut, there is no signal processing
                on these tracks.</p>

            <h3>Lead guitars</h3>

            <p>In this song, the lead guitars appear during the chorus and while the voice is loud and proud, so I won’t
                try to give it lead guitar aesthetics. Instead I’ll try to use them as a stereo guitar layer. We already
                have 6 tracks of distorted guitars, so we’ll have to find some space left in the mix to cram 4 more
                tracks. I’ll do so by reducing the low-frequency information on these lead tracks and by slightly
                boosting some mids. I have to be careful so the overall guitars don’t sound suddenly louder when the
                lead comes up. To achieve this I will lower the other distorted guitars slightly when these come up,
                much like a manual compressor.

            <h3>Lead voice</h3>

            <p>It’s a single well sung mono track so I’ll try not to ruin it. Low cut on 100Hz a loads of compression
                will do just fine for now.
            </p>

            <h3>Background voice</h3>

            <p>Hard paned, 100Hz cut, a somewhat aggressive de-hisser and heavy compression are in order here. Some part
                of the songs have mellow falsetto voicings while others have screams so I will use automation to control
                both the volume and the amount of effect (delay) used here.</p>

            <p>Just by summing all of the above we get a decent starting point, but to do a great mix we must revisit
                all the instruments, several times, while listening to the final result. It's a cyclic process that ends
                whenever
                you say it's enough.
